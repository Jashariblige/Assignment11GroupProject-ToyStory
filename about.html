            <p class="about__text"> Toy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles  on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend. The film received three Academy Award nominations: Best Original Screenplay (the first animated film to be nominated for this award), Best Original Song for "You've Got a Friend in Me", and Best Original Score, as well as honoring a non-competitive Special Achievement Academy Award. Toy Story was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant", one of seven films designated in its first year of eligibility. The success of Toy Story launched a multimedia franchise and a series of three sequels. (Sourced from Wikepedia)<br><br></p>
            <p class="about__text">The story takes place in a world where toys come to life. Viewers are introduced to an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named Woody and a modern space cadet action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz when he becomes their owner Andy's favorite toy.The movie found it's origins when Disney asked Lasseter of Pixar to produce a computer-animated feature film that was told from a small toy's perspective, after the success of his short film Tin Toy, an award-winning film that became the first computer-generated film to win the  Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. <br><br></p>
